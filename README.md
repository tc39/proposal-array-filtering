# proposal-array-filtering

A proposal to add `Array.prototype.filterReject`.

```js
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// filter keeps the items that return true.
array.filter(i => (i < 3)); // => [1, 2];

// filterReject removes the items that return true.
array.filterReject(i => (i < 3)); // => [3, 4, 5];
```

## Motivation

`Array.p.filter` is confusing. I constantly have to ask myself "am I
keeping, or filtering out the current item?".

<dl>
  <dt>"Keeping"</dt>
  <dd>

  Implies that returning `true` would keep the current item.

  </dd>

  <dt>"Filtering out"</dt>
  <dd>

  Implies that returning `true` would remove the current item.

  </dd>
</dl>

`Array.p.filter` acts as "keeping". But when I think of the word
"filter", I think of "filtering out". So every time that I attempt to
write an array filter, I end up writing the opposite of what I intended.

`Array.p.filterReject` attempts to fix this confusion. By providing a
clearly named filtering function that matches my intuition, I'm able
what will happen when calling `filterReject`. And because it exists, I'm
able to assume that `filter` does something different, so it must be
"keep" version.
